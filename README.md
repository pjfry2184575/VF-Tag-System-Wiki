# VF Wiki Tag System 

![a7b69c41710525a3cd0e3fec9784f5d9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66041755/214806929-c93a9c4f-3be4-46ee-890e-5bd6f2188f24.png)

## 

I made this with the help of Blargbot#0128, using their public tag system.

Tags are different than custom commands, where as ccommands are limited to a single server, Tags can be accessed from any server the bot is in.

By using the tag system, I can provide this Wiki information to any server that invites the bot and knows the naming scheme of the Tags.

The ***Bot's Default Prefix*** is ***`b!`***.<br>
To set a personal server prefix. 
<br>**Send**:<br>```b!prefix add prefix``` <br>**Example**:<br>
```b!prefix add !```
<br><br><br>
__**This is the bot's invite link**__
```https://bit.ly/VF_Wiki-bot_Invite```<br>Yes, he's supposed to do that. 

Outside of using the Tag system, To actually use the bot, you will need coding skills.

This bot is the literal definition of a Fully Customizable Bot.
You will need to learn their bot's language, BBTag!
